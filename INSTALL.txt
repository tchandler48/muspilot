PILOT INSTALLATION:

	Below are simple instructions on how to install PILOT.  Notes
	about the usage are also included.

	Load all the *.c and *.h files to the MUSIC/SP system.  I use
	the ftp system of MUSIC/SP.

	The file pilot.c includes all the source code.  It will load the
       various .h files that it needs.

       Pilot compiles via the watc compiler.  The pilot.c source file 
       has the various watc commands in it.  type pilot.c at the command
  	line and the MUSIC/SP system will comile the complete package.


PILOT USAGE:

	To execute pilot, type pilot pg_name (ex. pilot hello.p.  All pilot
	programs must use the file identifier of .p

	It should be running.  (I hope)
